### Process

- Maybe someone not hired for below reasons -
  - Verbose - repeating the same statements twice or more times. (It is little bit irritating, isn't it?)
  - Superficial - Omit examples, increase abstractions (We should give more constructive real life examples, don't we?)
  - Unstructured - "thinking out loud" is not a benefit (unless it's been directly requested). ---> I think we can do this but we should not represent our banal thoughts there. Because they need very constructive answers with explanation.
