# Introduction

**You can't learn Linux without using it**

The linux shell is called `bash shell` which stands for Bourne Again Shell. It is named after the creator Stephen Bourne. There are different types of shells are out there.
 - c shell (csh)
 - korn shell (ksh)
 - ash shell
 - tcsh shell (an improved c shell)

In our terminal, `$` is for normal user, `#` for `root` user.

`who am i` -> giving the current user
`grep [username] /etc/passwd` -> giving the definition of my user account and my default shell. But we can also use `grep` differently, like - `cd /etc => cat passwd | grep [username]`
`date` - giving current date
`hostname` - computer's hostname

`man bash` - documentation for commands, file formats and other components in Linux.

`ls -lat` - l - long listing, a - hidden files, t - sort by time, newest first.

`ls --hide=[filename]` - do not show the [filename] when listing the files.

--there is a difference between argument and option. Options are command specific thing where arguments are passed to the command. Like `tar -xvf /home/nowshad`, here -xvf is the option and /home/nowshad is the argument.

`uname -a` - print system information.

`man date` - to see available formatting options
- `date +'%d/%m/%y'` - 04/03/20
- `date +'%A, %b, %d, %Y'` - Wednesday, March 04, 2020
