"Deep Work" by Cal Newport is a book that completely improved my productivity a few years ago. Can't recommend it enough 👍

What is it? Deep work is distraction-free, high concentration work that creates a lot of value in a little time. It's how I'm able to balance lots of meetings with knocking out design or strategy docs or creating slides during the day.

Why is deep work useful? It maximizes the amount of productivity you squeeze out of a limited time by focusing on a *single* task. No distractions, no Twitter, no chat or email. You reserve deep work for tasks that are cognitive heavy. Some brief lessons:

1. Be intentional about how you use your time.

2. Work on 1 task at a time, ideally in a distraction-free environment. Even just putting on your headphones and turning off notifications can be a big help. To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction.

3. If you service low-impact activities, you're taking away time you could be spending on higher-impact activities. It's a zero-sum game.

4. The core components of deliberate practice are identified as follows: your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve, you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive.

5. Resting your mind improves focused work. You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. It's like a muscle that gets tired.
