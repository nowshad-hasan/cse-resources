### Discussion

Q1. You're in a backend interview.

They ask:
"Design a rate limiting system for an API used by millions. Where do you start?"

Here‚Äôs how you impress üëá

1.Start with the goal:
Prevent abuse, ensure fair usage, and protect system stability.


2. Choose a rate-limiting strategy:
 - Fixed window
 - Sliding window
 - Token bucket (most flexible for millions of users)
 - Leaky bucket

3. Decide on the granularity:
 - Per user? Per IP? Per API key?
 - Define the limit (e.g. 100 req/min)

4. Pick a fast, distributed store:
 Use Redis to track usage‚Äîfast reads/writes, with key expiry support.

5. Implementation flow:
 - Each request checks Redis.
 - If within limit ‚Üí continue.
 - Else ‚Üí return 429 Too Many Requests.

6. Make it scalable:
 - Use Redis clusters for horizontal scaling.
 - Hash keys for sharding.
 - Push logic to API gateways like Kong or Cloudflare Workers for global edge enforcement.

7. Add burst control and global override flags:

 Here are 10 things you will need to build a top notch production grade API:

1. Proper URL path name and parameter convention - Follow RESTful conventions, and ensure the path is descriptive enough so devs/anyone can understand its purpose.

2. Proper REST method - Learn the purpose of each REST method and use them accordingly, e.g. fetching with GET, updating with PUT, creating with POST etc. Sometimes there are exceptions to this, but get the basics right

3. Authorization / Authentication - if the API you're building should be protected with certain permissions, be sure to include auth checks. Also learn the difference between Authn and Authz.

4. Validation Middleware - there are typically standard libraries/packages for API request validation. Use them! Each request should be properly validated, while returning proper error messages, to make sure the backend is not unnecessarily processing invalid data.

5. Controller / Service separation - Don't put all your eggs in one basket. i.e. separate your routes/controllers from your logic into separate service files. This is paramount in order for your code to be more modular, maintainable, reusable, and testable. Keep your controllers lean.

6. Logging - Application logs and error logs / stack traces are important for debugging things in production. It's important to not have too many logs, but just enough to at least identify potential issues in your code.

7. Error handling - Users don't want to see "Internal server error" or "something went wrong". Always try/catch your code wherever it can break (which is almost everywhere), and be sure to return proper error messages to inform the client accordingly.

8. Proper REST return status codes - There are specific REST response status codes for a reason. Study up on their use cases, learn the most commonly used ones, and keep the context of the API in mind while returning the response.

9. Consistent response formats - One API responds with { data: { items: [] } }, and another one responds with { items: [ ] } - this can be confusing and troublesome for frontend engineers to integrate your APIs. Use a utility function to centralize response formatting.

10. Documentation - these days frameworks auto generate docs based on DTOs etc, but sometimes there are details or caveats that is worth explicitly mentioning.

Bonus points for keeping these things in mind:
- Statelessness
- Caching commonly used APIs
- Using database transactions within each API to maintain ACID
- Rate limiting
