- How to hunt job in Germany?
By [Simona Luca](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simona-luca/)
Stop Using This CV Template When Job-Hunting in Germany!
Are you also using that plain, one-column CV template (see picture below) when applying for jobs in Germany? ⛔ Do yourself a favour and stop right now - it’s not working (in most cases)!

I’ve screened hundreds of CVs over the last four years, and roughly 90% of candidates rely on the same neutral, “celebrated” LinkedIn template. It may fly in the US or China, but in Germany, it barely gets a second glance. 

German recruiters expect something very different.

Here’s what your German-style CV should look like:
1️⃣ Two-Column Layout
Left column: Personal/contact details, languages, skills, (optional) interests
Right column: work experience, education, projects, certifications

2️⃣ Section Order & Headings
Header (with a professional photo)
Profile Summary (3–4 lines)
Work Experience (reverse-chronological)
Education & Certifications
Core Expertise, Languages, Strengths
IT Skills
Volunteer / Other Engagement (optional)

3️⃣ Professional Photo
Invest in a business portrait: studio lighting, neutral background, business attire
Why? In Germany, a photo personalizes your application and shows respect for local norms - plus it helps recruiters form a positive first impression in seconds.

4️⃣ Clear Section Titles for ATS Compatibility
Use standard headings:
Work Experience • Education • Certifications • Expertise • Languages • IT Skills • Strengths

5️⃣ Formalities
Include date & signature at the end. In Germany, your CV is an official document that must be up-to-date and signed.

6️⃣ German-Market Extras
Personal details: Date of birth, birthplace, nationality (expected, though not mandatory)
References: Contact details for one or two referees

7️⃣ Content & Impact
- Always list period, location (company), your outcomes and measurable impact
- Focus on value: Highlight achievements that directly align with your target role
- Stand out: Only 10% of candidates who market themselves boldly get noticed, often over the best qualified.

❓Why do you need more than a bland, text-heavy document?
 In a sea of neutral templates, you need to spark curiosity. Make recruiters think, “Who is this person? I want to learn more.” Show structure, personality and provide relevant content and you’ll be part of the 10% who secure interviews.

If you're applying for jobs, here are 5 pro-tips for your resume

1. Check spelling and grammar - It doesn't look good when we see issues with spelling or English. Use any of the free tools available online to check and fix these issues.
 
2. Make sure your Linkedin / portfolio / Github links are working - Many times I tried to click on resume links, and they would not open to the site. It's still okay if you give the full URL, but if you're saving space by hyperlinking a keyword, check to make sure they open to the right pages.
 
3. Use a standard readable format - Don't go too crazy on the resume format (unless you're a UI designer). Keep your resume simple, the sections neatly organized, and the content easily readable (e.g. top to bottom, not all over the place).
 
4. Always send a PDF document - Never use a word / editable format. PDF keeps it professional, and the formatting intact.
 
5. Properly name your resume file - I see a lot of resumes like "CV.pdf" or "Sabbir resume.pdf". It would be best if you include your full name, and brief title in the file name like "Sabbir Siddiqui Resume - Full stack Python React", so at a glance recruiters can pick it out of a folder

Bonus tip: Keep it short - A resume is a single page summary, while a CV is a full history of your experience and achievements, technically speaking. Don't send something that's 4-5 pages long, keep it up to max 2 pages long.
