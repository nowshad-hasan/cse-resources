1) Build a story bank 
- Create a library of 10-15 stories in STAR format
- Link each story to common interview questions it might apply to
- Bias towards recent stories, if possible 

2) Mistakes level you
- When asked about mistakes, don’t choose trivial examples to look good
- Mistakes give clues about your level of experience 
- If your biggest career mistake is “breaking a software build”, you probably haven’t had a big scope. 

3) Audit your stories for clarity
- Ask family or friends for feedback on your stories
- Make the situation, task, and result short and clear. 
- If your stories confuse strangers, they will confuse the interviewer. 

4) Specificity matters 
- Be specific in your answers about what you did
- “I led the project” leaves an open loop. Close it.
- Numbers build trust
- “Improved wait time” vs “Improved wait time from 4 hours to 10 minutes”

5) Don’t use “we” statements:
- When answering questions, don’t use “We”. Use “I”.
- An interviewer wants to know what “you” did
- When you say “we”, your answer loses credibility
