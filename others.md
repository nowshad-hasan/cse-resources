"How to change your mood" 
 
Whether you're aiming for productivity, looking for motivation, or simply wishing to grow, understanding how to effectively change your mood to match your goals is crucial. Here are some strategies that might help. 
 
Quick Mood Enhancers 
 
15 minutes to spare? 
 
- TED Talks: A quick, inspiring TED Talk can shift your perspective and elevate your mood. 
- Meditation and Breathwork: These practices bring a sense of calm and can reset your mood. 
- Cardio Exercise: Even a short burst of cardio can release endorphins, boosting your happiness. 
 
30 minutes in hand? 
 
- Reading: Immersing yourself in a good book can be a great escape. 
- Nature Time: A short walk in nature can refresh your mind and soul. 
- Engaging Activities (45 minutes - 1 hour) 
 
Got 45 minutes? 
 
- Call a Friend: Connecting with someone you care about can be uplifting. 
- Journaling: Writing down your thoughts can offer clarity and peace of mind. 
 
An hour to unwind? 
 
- Comfort TV Shows: Sometimes, a familiar show can be the perfect way to relax. 
- Podcasts: Engaging with topics you love through podcasts can be both educational and mood-lifting. 
- Yoga: This combines physical movement with mental relaxation, a perfect recipe for mood enhancement. 
- Extended Mood-Boosting Activities 
 
More than an hour? 
 
Passion Projects: Engaging in a hobby or a project you're passionate about can be incredibly satisfying. 
 
Personal Tips 
 
Beyond these general suggestions, personal preferences play a significant role in mood management. For instance, some find a cold shower invigorating and alerting, while others might prefer a cranial massage for its calming and relaxing effects. 

<!--  -->

If you're a fresher / job seeker who's looking to start a personal project, here's a pro tip - search "production ready template" on Github for whatever you're trying to build.

Use the template to learn about how software engineers actually build applications in the real world.

Trying to build a backend API with NodeJS? Google "production ready nodejs backend template"

Replace the "nodejs backend" with whatever you need.

Some things you can do to learn:
‚Ä¢ Observe the folder structure, how the files are organized
‚Ä¢ Observe the coding patterns, how functions, classes, code and logic is organized
‚Ä¢ Check the project dependencies (e.g. package.json, requirements.txt etc), look up what each one does

These days we don't really start new projects from scratch, we all have some templates that we use to get started. For freshers, using a 'production ready' template will be both good for their resume, and also to learn about what we actually do in the industry.

<!--  -->

The purpose of reviewing code is not to point out mistakes. It's to

1. Share knowledge within your team and increase team collaboration

2. Elevate code quality and standards - use of proper design patterns, coding principles, structure, separation of concerns, etc.

3. Identify gaps or areas for improvement e.g. edge cases or impact considerations 

Things to avoid:
1. Nitpicking code styles or formatting issues - this should already be taken care of by pre-commit linters and formatters

2. Nitpicking implementation styles - not everyone's code will look the same. just because you might not "like" the way something is done, does not necessarily mean that it warrants a redo. Make a judgement call, if readability and maintainability seems good, let's go with it.

3. Negative comments only - be sure to include positive comments to support your colleague's good work

4. Diversify your reviewer - two people should not always review each other's code, otherwise they will end up with blinders. Randomize who reviews your code to get different perspectives.

If possible, do the code reviews 1-1 in a call / meeting. Face to face is way better than async and leads to better team collaboration as well. If this gets tedious, you can also try a hybrid method where you do a 1-1 call after the initial implementation structure is ready, and then do an async review once the feature development is completed. Find out what works best for your team!

<!--  -->

Don't sit and wait around half a day for your pull request to get reviewed.

If you raise a pull request, you are not really transferring the responsibility of the task to the reviewer. It is still your responsibility to make sure that the review is done sooner than later.

If the review is getting delayed, follow up with your colleague, or if they are busy, try to reach out to others to get it done.

When you take up a task, you should take on the ownership of the task until the end of it's lifecycle.

Like and repost if you found this useful!

Edit: If you follow the PR process in your team, the best practice is to keep your PRs small, so that it can be reviewed in a few minutes. PRs with 20 files and

Have you ever felt like your entire day was wasted? Maybe because of long meetings, technical blockers, context switching, and distractions, you couldn't get anything done?

Here are 5 ways you can cope with productivity slumps:

1. If you cannot give input or get any output from a meeting, don't attend it / leave. No use sitting and listening in on a meeting without any value. Remember to politely excuse yourself, or at least ask "is there anything else needed from me? Otherwise I will drop off".

2. If a meeting is going over-time or beyond the agenda, try to steer others towards the agenda to stay on time and on topic. Note down the follow-ups and share it with the group after the meeting.

3. If you're stuck on a problem that won't budge, you could take a break and approach the problem with a fresh mind. Or sometimes a second pair of eyes really help - ask someone for help, or delegate.

4. When you're planning the sprint, consider the hours/capacity for scheduled meetings, and add some buffer time for unplanned meetings or contingencies.

5. Block time for productive work - set aside some slots in your calendar for deep focused work. Set an agenda for yourself to complete within that time.

At the end of the day, stuff happens. You might even waste an entire day without writing any code. It's important to prioritize, delegate, notify others, and manage your own and stakeholders' expectations.

Here's how you can be an irreplacable member of your software engineering team:

1. Take ownership of your tasks
2. Be proactive in solving problems and unblocking others
3. Contribute an intentional obscure bug in a critical application flow, that would generally go unnoticed, but would pop up once in a while and threaten to impact thousands of dollars, which of course only you yourself can rectify, so that whenever the bug pops up it will require your intervention, and you can save the day.
