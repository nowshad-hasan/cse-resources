### Discussions

üîπ Smoke Testing 
This is done after API development is complete. Simply validate if the APIs are working and nothing breaks. 
 
üîπ Functional Testing 
This creates a test plan based on the functional requirements and compares the results with the expected results. 
 
üîπ Integration Testing 
This test combines several API calls to perform end-to-end tests. The intra-service communications and data transmissions are tested. 
 
üîπ Regression Testing 
This test ensures that bug fixes or new features shouldn‚Äôt break the existing behaviors of APIs. 
 
üîπ Load Testing 
This tests applications‚Äô performance by simulating different loads. Then we can calculate the capacity of the application. 
 
üîπ Stress Testing 
We deliberately create high loads to the APIs and test if the APIs are able to function normally. 
 
üîπ Security Testing 
This tests the APIs against all possible external threats. 
 
üîπ UI Testing 
This tests the UI interactions with the APIs to make sure the data can be displayed properly. 
 
üîπ Fuzz Testing 
This injects invalid or unexpected input data into the API and tries to crash the API. In this way, it identifies the API vulnerabilities.

Test Automation in hashtag#Flutter !!üëÄ

Flutter itself comes with a rich set of testing features. 
üîπFor hashtag#unit testing, there‚Äôs a rich set of APIs to test individual functions, classes, and methods. 
üîπFor hashtag#widget testing, you can create widget tests to test a single widget.
üîπfor hashtag#integration testing, Flutter provides a separate package, hashtag#flutter_driver, to create UI tests that simulate actual user interaction. 
But for some specific use-cases here is the best available open-source option like hashtag#Appium

‚úÖ Appium is an open-source tool for automating native, mobile web, and hybrid applications on iOS mobile, Android mobile, and Windows desktop platforms. It‚Äôs used to conduct UI tests for the functionality of the software application.

‚úÖ Features:
- Cross-platform Support of Android, iOS, and Windows.
- Supports Multiple Languages which have Selenium client libraries, such as Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript with Node.js, and C#, among others.
- Does not require you to have access to your app‚Äôs source code or require you to include an SDK or recompile your app in any way.
- Supports Automation of Various Types of Apps: native, hybrid, and mobile web application automation.
